1. Consider the following Perl script:

my $a = 1;
sub callee { print "$a\n"; }
sub outer { my $a = 2; callee(); }
outer();

What does it print? How does the print statement look up variable $a? 




2. Write a regular expression that captures the PID and CMD from a line of output of the ps command on Linux. For example, consider the following output:

bash:~> ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 4702 pts/2    00:00:00 bash
 4739 pts/2    00:00:00 ps

The PID of bash is 4702, and the PID of ps is 4739. 


3. Develop a regular expression to match string, int, floating point numbers.


4. Make a program which read in a file, get rid of gap characters ('-'), and print out the cleaned file. 

files content start:
1 - I or V
2 - any
3 - D
4 - S
5 - G, A, or S
6 - G, A, S, or C
7 - G, A, S, or T
8 - G or A
9 - T 
files content end:


#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

open('DATA', '<file.txt') or die "$!";
open('DATA1', '>>file.txt') or die "$!";

while (<DATA>){
	if ($_ =~ s/\s-\s//){
		print DATA1 "$_\n";
	}
}
close(DATA);
close(DATA1);
